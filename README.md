# Google Ads MCP Server

This repo contains the source code for running a local
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that interacts with the
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api).

## Tools

The server uses the
[Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v21/overview)
to provide several
[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) for use with LLMs.

### Tools available

- `search`: Retrieves information about the Google Ads account.
- `list_accessible_customers`: Returns names of customers directly accessible
  by the user authenticating the call.

## Notes

1.  The MCP Server will expose your data to the Agent or LLM that you connect to it.
1.  If you have technical issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp/issues).
1.  To help us collect usage data, you will notice an extra header has been added to your API calls, this data is used to improve the product.

## Setup instructions

Setup involves the following steps:

1.  Configure Python.
1.  Configure Developer Token.
1.  Enable APIs in your project
1.  Configure Credentials.
1.  Configure Gemini.

### Configure Python

[Install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx).

### Configure Developer Token

Follow the instructions for [Obtaining a Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/get-started/dev-token).

Record 'YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN', you will need this for the the 'Configure Gemini' step below

### Enable APIs in your project

[Follow the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)
to enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud project:

* [Google Ads API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/googleads.googleapis.com)

### Configure Credentials
#### Option 1: Using FastMCP OAuth Proxy

The server supports FastMCP's [OAuth proxy](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) feature for dynamic user authentication. This is useful when running the server as a web service.

To enable it, set the following environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client Secret.
- `GOOGLE_ADS_MCP_BASE_URL`: (Optional) The base URL where the server is accessible (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).

Once this is enabled, you can authenticate to the API through your MCP client: for example, in Gemini CLI, the command `/mcp auth google-ads-mcp` triggers the authentication flow.

When these variables are set, the server automatically switches to the `streamable-http` transport (SSE/HTTP) instead of stdio.

You will need to run the server as a separate process and configure your MCP client to connect to the SSE endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/mcp`).

#### Option 2: Configure credentials using Application Default Credentials

Configure your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
Make sure the credentials are for a user with access to your Google Ads
accounts or properties.

Credentials must include the Google Ads API scope:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords
```

Check out
[Manage OAuth Clients](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257)
for how to create an OAuth client.

Here are some sample `gcloud` commands you might find useful:


- Set up ADC using user credentials and an OAuth desktop or web client after
  downloading the client JSON to `YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE`.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
    --client-id-file=YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE
  ```

- Set up ADC using service account impersonation.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  ```

When the `gcloud auth application-default` command completes, copy the
`PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` file location printed to the console in the
following message. You will need this for a later step!

```
Credentials saved to file: [PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON]
```

#### Option 3: Configure credentials using the Google Ads API Python client library.

[Follow the instructions](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/python/)
to setup and configure the Google Ads API Python client library

If you have already done this and have a working `google-ads.yaml` , you can reuse this file!

In the utils.py file, change get_googleads_client() to use the load_from_storage() method.

### Configure Gemini

1.  Install [Gemini
    CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/index.md)
    or [Gemini Code
    Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist)

1.  Create or edit the file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`, adding your server
    to the `mcpServers` list.


- Option 1: Using FastMCP OAuth Proxy (Streamable HTTP)

  You can run the server as a separate process and configure your MCP client to connect to the SSE endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/mcp`).
  This also allows using FastMCP's [OAuth proxy](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/oauth-proxy) feature for dynamic user authentication.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-ads-mcp": {
          "httpUrl":"http://localhost:8000/mcp",
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"                        
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- Option 2: the Application Default Credentials method

    Replace `PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` with the path you copied in the previous
    step.

    We also recommend that you add a `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` attribute to the
    `env` object. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in the following example with the
    [project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113) of your
    Google Cloud project.



    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-ads-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--spec",
            "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
            "google-ads-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- Option 3: the Python client library method

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "google-ads-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--spec",
            "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
            "google-ads-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Login Customer Id

If your access to the customer account is through a manager account, you will
need to add the customer ID of the manager account to the settings file.

See [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/concepts/call-structure#cid) for details.

The final file will look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "google-ads-mcp": {
        "command": "pipx",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--spec",
          "git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git",
          "google-ads-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
          "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN",
          "GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID": "YOUR_MANAGER_CUSTOMER_ID"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```


## Try it out

Launch Gemini Code Assist or Gemini CLI and type `/mcp`. You should see
`google-ads-mcp` listed in the results.

Here are some sample prompts to get you started:

- Ask what the server can do:

  ```
  what can the ads-mcp server do?
  ```

- Ask about customers:

  ```
  what customers do I have access to?
  ```

- Ask about campaigns 

  ```
  How many active campaigns do I have?
  ```

  ```
  How is my campaign performance this week?
  ```

### Note about Customer ID

Your agent will need and ask for a customer id for most prompts. If you are 
moving between multiple customers, including the customer ID in the prompt may
be simpler.

```
How many active campaigns do I have for customer id 1234567890
```


## Updating

The MCP server does not auto-update. When new changes are pushed to this repo,
you need to update your local installation manually.

### If you installed with `pipx run --spec git+...` (Gemini settings.json method)

Re-install to pull the latest version:

```shell
pipx run --spec git+https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-mcp.git google-ads-mcp --version
```

If `pipx` caches the old version, clear it first:

```shell
pipx run --clear-cache
```

### If you installed from a local clone (`pipx install -e .`)

Pull the latest changes and restart your client:

```shell
cd google-ads-mcp
git pull
```

Since editable installs link directly to your local files, the changes take
effect immediately — no reinstall needed.

### After updating

Restart your MCP client (Gemini CLI, Gemini Code Assist, Claude Code, etc.) to
pick up the changes.
